                            <h3>Pros</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Dual licence from Curacao eGaming and the Kahnawake Gaming Commission — one of the
                                    stronger regulatory combinations in the offshore space.</li>
                                <li>4,500+ casino games from 140+ providers including Evolution Gaming, Pragmatic Play,
                                    NetEnt, Big Time Gaming, and BGaming.</li>
                                <li>Fast e-wallet and crypto withdrawals: 1–3 hours once KYC is cleared, with no pending
                                    period for verified accounts.</li>
                                <li>High Safety Index of 8.2/10 (Casino.guru), reflecting fair terms, clean complaint
                                    history, and transparent operations.</li>
                                <li>Progressive jackpots paid in full regardless of size — no instalment splits.</li>
                                <li>Multi-tiered VIP programme with weekly challenges, personal account managers at
                                    higher tiers, and exclusive promotions.</li>
                                <li>24/7 live chat support, typically connecting to a human agent within seconds.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="cons-panel">
                            <h3>Cons</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Full KYC mandatory before any withdrawal — ID, proof of address, and payment method
                                    verification all required.</li>
                                <li>KYC delays reported by some players, with document review occasionally taking up to
                                    4 days in peak periods.</li>
                                <li>Card and bank transfer withdrawals take 3–7 business days — considerably slower than
                                    e-wallet and crypto options.</li>
                                <li>No two-factor authentication (2FA) available on accounts — a notable security gap
                                    versus competitors.</li>
                                <li>Daily withdrawal limit of €4,000 may restrict high-volume players outside of VIP
                                    tiers.</li>
                            </ul>

                    </div>

                    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
                    <p>Registering at National Casino is straightforward and takes around two to three minutes.
                        You'll be prompted to provide your full name, date of birth, address, phone number, email,
                        and preferred currency. It is important that all details match your government-issued
                        identification exactly, as discrepancies during KYC verification are the most common
                        cause of delayed or rejected withdrawals. Once your account is created and confirmed
                        via email, you can deposit immediately and access the full game library including demo
                        play on most slots.</p>

                    <p>National Casino employs a <strong>tiered KYC verification system</strong>. Approximately
                        75% of players are automatically verified at Tier 1 through data-matching with trusted
                        databases, meaning they never need to manually submit documents. When automatic
                        verification is not possible, Tier 2 requires standard document submission. Tier 3
                        enhanced due diligence applies only to high-volume players making substantial
                        withdrawals. Despite this tiered approach, <strong>full KYC is mandatory before any
                            withdrawal</strong> can be released, and players who encounter the verification queue
                        should submit their documents proactively — prior to requesting their first cashout —
                        to avoid delays.</p>

                    <h3>Bonus &amp; Promotions</h3>
                    <p>New players at National Casino receive a 100% match on their first deposit up to €500,
                        plus 100 Free Spins. The free spins are credited gradually — typically 20 per day
                        over five consecutive days — on a pre-selected featured slot. The minimum qualifying
                        deposit is €20, and Skrill and Neteller deposits are excluded from the bonus. A
                        standard and a high-roller bonus card are available at the cashier, giving players
                        with larger bankrolls access to an enhanced offer. Select the bonus card before
                        completing your deposit transaction; it cannot be applied retroactively.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Welcome Bonus:</strong> 100% up to €500 + 100 Free Spins</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum deposit to activate:</strong> €20</li>
                        <li><strong>Excluded deposit methods:</strong> Skrill, Neteller</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering requirement:</strong> 40x the bonus amount</li>
                        <li><strong>Maximum bet with active bonus:</strong> €5 per spin / per hand</li>
                        <li><strong>Bonus validity:</strong> 7 days to complete wagering</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Recurring promotions include a Monday Reload Bonus (50% up to a set amount),
                        weekly cashback on losses, free spins campaigns tied to new game releases, and
                        multi-round tournament events with prize pools distributed across the leaderboard.
                        An automatic withdrawal scheduling feature is also available, allowing players to
                        pre-set cashout triggers at defined balance thresholds — a feature particularly
                        valued by regular players who want to remove winnings without manual intervention.</p>

                    <h2>Games &amp; Software Providers</h2>
                    <p>National Casino hosts over 4,500 real-money titles across all major categories, making
                        it one of the larger libraries available to Irish players. The majority of the portfolio
                        consists of slots — over 4,200 titles — covering classic three-reels, modern video
                        slots, Megaways mechanics, and cluster-pays formats. Jackpot games are available
                        throughout the lobby; the casino pays all progressive jackpot wins in full with no
                        instalment structure, and jackpot winners are assigned a dedicated support contact
                        to streamline the verification and payout process.</p>

                    <p>The live casino draws from Evolution Gaming, Pragmatic Play Live, Ezugi, and several
                        additional studios, offering live Roulette, Blackjack (multiple variants), Baccarat,
                        Dragon Tiger, and game show formats such as Crazy Time and Monopoly Live. Betting
                        limits at live tables range from €0.10 to several thousand euro per hand. RNG table
                        games, video poker, bingo, dice games, and crash titles (including Aviator and
                        JetX) round out the offering. Key software providers include BGaming, Blueprint
                        Gaming, Big Time Gaming, Amatic, Betsoft, 1x2 Gaming (65+ titles), and more than
                        130 additional studios.</p>

                    <h2>Payments &amp; Withdrawal Speeds</h2>
                    <p>National Casino supports a broad range of deposit and withdrawal methods. The minimum
                        deposit is €10, though the welcome bonus requires at least €20. Accepted methods
                        include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cards: Visa, Mastercard</li>
                        <li>E-wallets: Skrill, Neteller, ecoPayz</li>
                        <li>Prepaid: Paysafecard</li>
                        <li>Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and others</li>
                        <li>Bank Transfer (minimum withdrawal: €500)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>National Casino charges no fees on withdrawals from its side; however, your payment
                        provider may apply their own network or processing charges. <strong>Withdrawal speeds
                            by method:</strong> e-wallets and crypto are processed within 1–3 hours for verified
                        accounts, with no pending period once KYC is complete. Card withdrawals take 3–5
                        business days. Bank transfers can require up to 7 business days and carry a higher
                        minimum of €500. Standard withdrawal limits are €4,000 per day, €16,000 per week,
                        and €50,000 per month. VIP players are eligible for elevated limits based on their
                        tier.</p>

                    <p>First-time withdrawals are subject to a full KYC check, which typically takes a
                        few hours but may extend up to 48 hours in cases requiring manual review. Players
                        are strongly advised to upload their verification documents — government-issued
                        ID, proof of address dated within 90 days, and payment method confirmation — as
                        soon as possible after registration rather than waiting until their first cashout
                        request.</p>

                    <h2>Security &amp; Fairness</h2>
                    <p>National Casino is owned and operated by <strong>TechSolutions Group N.V.</strong>,
                        the same holding company behind 22Bet, 20Bet, Playamo, and Bizzo Casino. The platform
                        holds dual licences from the Curacao eGaming authority and the Kahnawake Gaming
                        Commission — the latter being a more rigorous regulator with established dispute

                    <p>Games are provided exclusively by certified studios with independently verified RNG
                        systems. Regular third-party audits are conducted to confirm ongoing game fairness.
                        Responsible gambling tools include deposit limits, session time reminders, and
                        self-exclusion available via live chat. One notable security gap is the absence of
                        two-factor authentication (2FA) — players should ensure they use a strong, unique
                        password and remain vigilant about phishing. Customer support operates 24/7 via live
                        chat, with sub-one-minute response times in testing, and via email for documentation-
                        heavy queries such as KYC and payment disputes. Irish players are currently accepted

                    <button class="faq-question">
                        Does National Casino require KYC verification?
                        <div class="faq-icon"></div>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Full KYC verification is mandatory before National Casino will release any
                            withdrawal. The casino uses a three-tier verification system: approximately 75%
                            of players are auto-verified at Tier 1 through database matching and never need
                            to submit documents manually. When automatic verification fails, Tier 2 requires
                            you to upload a valid government-issued photo ID (passport, national ID, or
                            driving licence), a proof of address dated within 90 days (utility bill, bank
                            statement, or mobile invoice), and confirmation of your payment method. The review
                            typically takes a few hours but can extend up to 48 hours. To avoid delays on
                            your first withdrawal, complete document submission as soon as you register.</p>

                        What is the National Casino welcome bonus?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>New players receive a 100% deposit match up to €500, plus 100 Free Spins. The
                            minimum qualifying deposit is €20. Skrill and Neteller deposits do not qualify

                            must be cleared within 7 days, and the maximum bet while using bonus funds is
                            €5 per spin or per hand. A high-roller bonus card offering an enhanced package
                            is also available at the cashier for players depositing larger amounts.</p>
