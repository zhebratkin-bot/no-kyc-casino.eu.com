                    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
                    <p>Signing up at Casombie casino online is an experience unlike most other platforms. Before
                        filling in your personal details, you are asked to <strong>choose a zombie avatar</strong>
                        from a selection of themed characters. Each avatar is tied to a different welcome bonus
                        package &mdash; with seven options available &mdash; so it is worth comparing the offers
                        carefully before committing. Your avatar choice is permanent and cannot be changed after
                        registration.</p>
                    <p>The registration form then requires your email address, username, password, phone number,
                        full name, date of birth, address, and preferred currency. Once complete, you confirm
                        your account via email and can log in immediately. <strong>KYC verification is mandatory
                        before your first withdrawal</strong> can be processed. The casino may request
                        documents at registration, after your first deposit, or when you submit a withdrawal
                        request. To avoid delays, Casombie recommends completing verification as soon as
                        your account is active. Verification typically takes 1&ndash;3 business days, though
                        the casino reserves up to 10 business days for complex cases.</p>

                    <h2>Casombie Bonus &amp; Promotions</h2>
                    <p>The Casombie bonus structure is one of the most creative in the Curacao-licensed market.
                        New players receive a <strong>100% match bonus up to &euro;500 plus 200 Free Spins</strong>
                        on their first deposit, delivered automatically after the qualifying deposit &mdash;
                        no Casombie bonus code is required. The 200 free spins are credited in batches of
                        20 per day over 10 days. As a welcome touch, even the menus on the promotions page
                        stay true to the zombie theme: &ldquo;Yummy Promotions&rdquo;, &ldquo;Haunted
                        Weekend&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Deadly Spins&rdquo; are real section names.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Casombie welcome bonus:</strong> 100% up to &euro;500 + 200 Free Spins</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum deposit to activate:</strong> &euro;20</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering requirement (bonus):</strong> 35x the deposit + bonus amount</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering requirement (free spin winnings):</strong> 40x</li>
                        <li><strong>Max bet with active bonus:</strong> &euro;5 per spin or round</li>
                        <li><strong>Bonus validity:</strong> 10 days from activation</li>
                        <li><strong>Casombie no deposit bonus code:</strong> Not available &mdash; no no-deposit offer currently exists</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The ongoing promotions calendar is among the strongest in its class. Weekly highlights
                        include <strong>Deadly Spins</strong> &mdash; 50 free spins on the first weekly deposit
                        of &euro;20+ (40x wagering on winnings) &mdash; and the <strong>Haunted Weekend</strong>
                        reload, a 50% bonus up to &euro;700 with 50 free spins (min &euro;50 for free spins,
                        35x on deposit bonus, 40x on spins). The <strong>Weekly Live Casino Cashback</strong>
                        refunds 25% of live casino losses up to &euro;200 with just 1x wagering, available
                        to all players. VIP members at Levels 3&ndash;5 also receive a <strong>weekly casino
                        cashback</strong> of up to 15% on all losses up to &euro;3,000 (also 1x wagering).
                        The <strong>Drops &amp; Wins</strong> network tournaments from Pragmatic Play add
                        further prize pool opportunities throughout the month.</p>

                    <h2>Casombie Gamification &amp; VIP</h2>
                    <p>What sets Casombie casino apart from the vast majority of Curacao-licensed operators is
                        its deep gamification layer. The platform runs a full <strong>Achievements</strong>
                        system where players complete tasks &mdash; such as making their first deposit, playing
                        a set number of rounds on a specific game, or hitting a win threshold &mdash; to earn
                        &ldquo;Brains&rdquo; (loyalty points). These Brains are then converted to bonus funds
                        and spent in the <strong>Dark Mall Shop</strong> on free spins, cash rewards, and
                        other prizes. <strong>Brain Ring Tournaments</strong> run alongside the standard
                        slot tournaments, adding a competitive layer to the gamified experience.</p>
                    <p>The five-tier VIP programme enrolls all players automatically from their first deposit.
                        Advancing through the levels unlocks higher monthly withdrawal limits (from
                        <strong>&euro;7,000 at Level 1</strong> up to <strong>&euro;20,000 at Level 5</strong>),
                        progressively better cashback rates, priority withdrawal processing, personalised
                        bonus offers, and a dedicated personal account manager at the top two tiers. VIP
                        ranking is calculated based on deposit and wagering activity over the preceding
                        30 days.</p>

                    <h2>Games &amp; Software Providers</h2>

                        Casombie does not charge withdrawal fees on its side.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All withdrawals are blocked until KYC verification has
                        been approved. Players who complete KYC immediately after registration typically
                        experience the smoothest and fastest withdrawal process.</p>

                        <p>Casombie is a zombie-themed online casino and sportsbook launched in 2020 and
                            operated by <strong>Rabidi N.V.</strong> under a Curacao licence (8048/JAZ).
                            It is aimed at players who want more than a standard casino lobby &mdash;
                            the platform layers achievements, tournaments, a reward shop, and avatar-based
                            welcome bonuses over a 4,000+ game library. It is particularly well-suited to
                            slots enthusiasts, live casino fans, and players who enjoy ongoing gamification
                            rewards. Irish players are currently accepted. Deposits must be wagered at
                            least 1x before any withdrawal is permitted.</p>

                        <p>New players at Casombie casino receive a <strong>100% match bonus up to
                            &euro;500 plus 200 Free Spins</strong> on their first qualifying deposit of
                            &euro;20 or more. The bonus is applied automatically &mdash; no Casombie bonus
                            code is required. Free spins are credited in batches of 20 per day over
                            10 days. The wagering requirement is 35x the combined deposit and bonus

                        Is there a Casombie casino no deposit bonus code?
                        <div class="faq-icon"></div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>No. As of our most recent review, Casombie casino does not offer a no deposit
                            bonus or a no deposit bonus code for new registrations. All welcome offers
                            require a qualifying deposit of at least &euro;20 to be activated. While
                            a Casombie casino no deposit bonus code is not currently available, the
                            platform does run a strong weekly promotions calendar including free spin
                            reloads, live casino cashback (25%, 1x wagering), and VIP cashback of up
                            to 15%. Check the Promotions section after registering for the latest
                            available offers as these are updated regularly.</p>

                        Does Casombie require KYC verification?
                        <div class="faq-icon"></div>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Casombie enforces a mandatory KYC process before any withdrawal can be
                            processed. Required documents include a government-issued photo ID (passport
                            or driving licence), proof of address (utility bill or bank statement no
                            older than 3&nbsp;months), and verification of your payment method.
                            Verification typically completes within 1&ndash;3 business days but can
                            extend up to 10 business days for complex cases. Completing KYC as soon
                            as you register is strongly recommended to ensure your first withdrawal
                            is processed without delay.</p>
