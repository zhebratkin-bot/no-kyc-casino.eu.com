                    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
                    <p>Signing up at BetHall casino takes under two minutes. Click the &ldquo;Register&rdquo; button on
                        the homepage, choose your welcome offer (casino or sportsbook), then complete the form with
                        your email address, password, full name, date of birth, and home address. Once the form is
                        submitted, you may be asked to confirm your email before gaining full access to the account
                        dashboard.</p>
                    <p><strong>KYC verification is mandatory before any withdrawal can be processed.</strong>
                        BetHall may request documents at any point &mdash; during registration, after your first
                        deposit, or at the time of your first withdrawal request. To avoid delays, the casino recommends
                        completing verification as soon as your account is created. You will need to submit a
                        government-issued photo ID (passport or driving licence), proof of address (utility bill or
                        bank statement no older than 3&nbsp;months), and verification of your chosen payment method.
                        Verification typically completes within 1&ndash;3 business days, though the casino reserves
                        up to 10 business days for the full process.</p>

                    <h2>Bonus &amp; Promotions</h2>
                    <p>BetHall casino&#x27;s welcome offer rewards new players with a <strong>100% match bonus up to
                        &euro;500 plus 200 Free Spins</strong> on the first qualifying deposit, together with one
                        free pick on the Bonus Crab claw machine. A minimum deposit of &euro;10 is needed to
                        unlock the Bonus Crab pick, while the full 100% bonus and free spins require a deposit of
                        &euro;20 or more. No promo code is required &mdash; the bonus is activated directly through
                        the Profile section after depositing.</p>
                    <ul>

                        3&ndash;5. The Bonus Shop lets players exchange loyalty coins for free spins and cash
                        rewards at any time, and the Bonus Crab machine provides additional prize opportunities
                        through the gamification layer.</p>

                    <h2>Games &amp; Software Providers</h2>
                    <p>Bet Hall offers one of the largest libraries among Anjouan-licensed platforms, with over
                        <strong>6,000 titles</strong> from more than 100 certified software studios. The slot
                        section is the core of the offering, spanning classic fruit machines, modern video slots,
                        Megaways titles, bonus buy games, and progressive jackpots. Stand-out titles in the
                        catalogue include Gates of Olympus, Sweet Bonanza, Razor Shark, Reactoonz, Money Train 3,
                        Wanted Dead or a Wild, and Gonzo&rsquo;s Quest, among thousands of others.</p>
                    <p>The live casino is powered by <strong>Evolution Gaming</strong>, which delivers an extensive
                        suite of Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, and Poker variants alongside game shows including
                        Crazy Time, Monopoly Live, and Lightning Roulette. Table game fans will also find video
                        poker, virtual sports, and a full jackpot section. BetHall&rsquo;s sportsbook covers
                        40+ categories &mdash; from football and basketball to eSports and virtual sports &mdash;
                        running alongside the casino on the same account and wallet. Notable software partners
                        include Pragmatic Play, Play&rsquo;n GO, Hacksaw Gaming, Nolimit City, NetEnt, ELK Studios,

                    <h2>Payments &amp; Withdrawal Speeds</h2>
                    <p>BetHall provides a detailed payments page that displays available methods, processing times,
                        and limits organised by country and currency &mdash; a level of transparency that is
                        notably above average for Anjouan-licensed operators. Accepted payment methods include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Tether (USDT)</li>
                        <li>Visa and Mastercard</li>
                        <li>Skrill, Neteller, Jeton, MiFinity, and Sticpay</li>
                        <li>Bank transfers and regional payment methods depending on your country</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All deposits are instant and fee-free on the casino&rsquo;s side. The minimum deposit is
                        &euro;20 for the welcome bonus (&euro;10 for the Bonus Crab pick). Cryptocurrency and
                        e-wallet withdrawals are processed instantly once approved, while card and bank transfer
                        payouts follow a 1&ndash;3 business day window. Monthly cashout limits are tiered by
                        VIP level, ranging from <strong>&euro;7,000 at Level 1</strong> up to
                        <strong>&euro;20,000 at Level 5</strong>. A maximum of three pending withdrawal
                        requests are allowed at any one time.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> All withdrawals are blocked until KYC verification has been
                        completed and approved. Players are strongly advised to submit verification documents
                        immediately after registration to ensure smooth and fast payouts when the time comes.</p>

                    <h2>Security &amp; Fairness</h2>
                    <p>BetHall casino is owned and operated by <strong>NovaForge Ltd</strong>, a company that
                        also manages several other active casino brands. The platform holds a gaming licence from
                        the <strong>Anjouan Gaming Authority</strong>. All player data and financial transactions

                        Game fairness is audited by independent testing laboratories, and all titles use
                        certified random number generators (RNG) to ensure unpredictable outcomes.</p>
                    <p>Responsible gambling tools available at BetHall include deposit limits, time-out periods,

                        Players from the UK and several other jurisdictions are not permitted to register.

                        Does BetHall require KYC verification?
                        <div class="faq-icon"></div>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. BetHall enforces a full KYC process before any withdrawal can be processed.
                            Required documents include a government-issued photo ID (passport or driving
                            licence), proof of address (utility bill or bank statement no older than
                            3&nbsp;months), and verification of your payment method. Verification typically
                            takes 1&ndash;3 business days but can extend up to 10 business days in
                            complex cases. Completing KYC immediately after registration is the most
                            effective way to avoid delays on your first withdrawal request.</p>
