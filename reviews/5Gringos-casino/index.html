                    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
                    <p>Signing up at 5Gringos Casino is a notably unique experience compared to most online casinos.
                        Before entering your personal details, you are asked to choose one of five themed "Gringo"
                        characters � each one unlocks a different welcome bonus. This choice is permanent and cannot
                        be changed after registration, so it is worth reviewing the offers for each character before
                        committing.</p>
                    <p>The registration form requires your email address, phone number, date of birth, and home address.
                        Account creation itself is quick, but it is important to note that <strong>KYC verification is
                        mandatory before your first withdrawal</strong> can be processed. The casino may request
                        documents either before or after your first deposit, or when you submit your withdrawal request.
                        Verification typically takes 1&ndash;3 days, though the casino reserves up to 10 business days
                        for the full process.</p>
                    <h3>Bonus &amp; Promotions</h3>
                    <p>5Gringos stands out with its character-based welcome system. The most popular first-deposit
                        bonus offers a 100% match up to &euro;500, bundled with 200 Free Spins delivered in batches of
                        20 per day over 10 days. A bonus crab is also awarded, redeemable through the casino's
                        interactive claw machine for additional prizes.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Welcome Bonus:</strong> 100% up to &euro;500 + 200 Free Spins</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum deposit to activate:</strong> &euro;20</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering requirement:</strong> 35x the bonus amount</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering on Free Spins winnings:</strong> 40x</li>
                        <li><strong>Max bet while clearing bonus:</strong> &euro;5</li>
                        <li><strong>Bonus validity:</strong> 10 days</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> Skrill and Neteller deposits do not qualify</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Beyond the welcome offer, 5Gringos runs a weekly reload bonus, a live casino cashback of up to
                        15%, weekend free spin promotions, seasonal tournaments, and an ongoing Heist challenge with
                        prize pools worth up to &euro;200. The Bonus Shop allows players to exchange loyalty points
                        for free spins and cash rewards at any time.</p>
                    <h2>Games &amp; Software Providers</h2>
                    <p>5Gringos boasts one of the largest game libraries among Curacao-licensed platforms, with over
                        9,000 titles sourced from 100+ software providers. Slots make up the core of the offering,
                        with high-volatility favourites from Nolimit City, Hacksaw Gaming, and Push Gaming sitting
                        alongside the classic catalogues of NetEnt, Microgaming, and Play'n GO.</p>
                    <p>The live casino section is powered by <strong>Evolution Gaming</strong> and Ezugi, covering
                        Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, and an extensive range of game shows including Crazy Time and
                        Monopoly Live. Table game fans will also find video poker, virtual sports, and a dedicated
                        jackpot section featuring several multi-million progressive prizes. The casino's proprietary
                        gamification layer � the Heist challenges and Shooting Range mini-games � adds a layer of
                        engagement that sets 5Gringos apart from standard casino formats.</p>
                    <h2>Payments &amp; Withdrawal Speeds</h2>
                    <p>5Gringos supports a broad mix of payment options, including bank transfers, credit and debit
                        cards, e-wallets, and cryptocurrencies. Key accepted methods include:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>All deposits are instant and fee-free on the casino's side. The minimum deposit is &euro;20.
                        Crypto and e-wallet withdrawals are processed instantly once approved, while card and bank
                        transfer payouts follow a 1&ndash;5 business day window. The minimum withdrawal is $15 for
                        crypto and $20 for e-vouchers. Monthly withdrawal limits are tiered by VIP level, ranging from
                        &euro;7,000 at Level 1 up to &euro;20,000 at Level 5.</p>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Withdrawals are blocked until KYC verification is complete.
                        Documents must be submitted and approved before any payout � regardless of the payment method
                        used.</p>
