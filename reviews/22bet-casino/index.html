                    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
                    <p>Creating an account at 22Bet is quick, with the process completable in under one minute.
                        Players can register via the standard form — entering their email, password, name, country,
                        and preferred currency — or use social sign-up via Google or Facebook for even faster
                        onboarding. Once registered, you can deposit and browse the full game library immediately.
                        A useful unique feature is 22Bet's account backup option: you can save your login credentials
                        as a file, image, or email, providing a secure record that is not commonly found elsewhere.</p>
                    <p><strong>KYC verification is mandatory before any withdrawal</strong> can be processed.
                        There is no requirement to verify immediately after signing up, and you can make deposits
                        freely without it. However, your first cashout request will be held pending until your
                        identity is confirmed. 22Bet recommends completing verification in advance to avoid delays.
                        The KYC check typically takes a few hours to complete, and once done, subsequent withdrawals
                        are approved significantly faster.</p>
                    <h3>Bonus &amp; Promotions</h3>
                    <p>New casino players receive a 100% deposit match up to &euro;300, plus 30 Free Spins on
                        selected slots. A separate sports welcome bonus is available for sportsbook players,
                        offering a 100% match up to &euro;122 on accumulators. Both bonuses are chosen at the
                        point of first deposit.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Casino Welcome Bonus:</strong> 100% up to &euro;300 + 30 Free Spins</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum deposit to activate:</strong> &euro;2</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering requirement:</strong> 50x the bonus amount</li>
                        <li><strong>Bonus validity:</strong> 7 days</li>
                        <li><strong>Important:</strong> Crypto deposits do not qualify for any welcome bonus</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ongoing promotions include a Wednesday Cash Splash (50% up to &euro;220 on casino deposits),
                        a Sunday Mega Bonus (66% up to &euro;100 + 50 Free Spins on Golden Mine), a Friday
                        Sportsbook Reload (100% up to &euro;100 on accumulators), and a weekly Slots Race with
                        a shared prize pool of $3,000 distributed among the top 30 finishers. A VIP cashback
                        programme rewards regular players with percentage returns on losses.</p>
                    <h2>Games &amp; Software Providers</h2>
                    <p>22Bet's casino lobby hosts over 5,000 titles from more than 100 software providers, making
                        it one of the most extensively stocked platforms in its tier. Slots form the core of the
                        offering, with content from major studios including Pragmatic Play, NetEnt, Play'n GO,
                        Big Time Gaming, Hacksaw Gaming, Betsoft, BGaming, and Spinomenal, alongside a long list
                        of smaller independent developers. Browsing is straightforward thanks to provider-based
                        filters and subcategories for jackpots, new releases, and popular titles.</p>
                    <p>The live casino draws from multiple studios — Evolution Gaming, Ezugi, Pragmatic Play Live,
                        Authentic Gaming, and SA Gaming among them — covering all standard formats from Roulette
                        and Blackjack (90+ variants) to Baccarat, Dragon Tiger, and game shows like Crazy Time
                        and Monopoly Live. Table limits range from &euro;1 up to tens of thousands per hand.
                        Beyond the casino, 22Bet operates a full poker room powered by Legion Poker, an instant
                        bingo section, crash games including the exclusive 22Crash, and a virtual sports suite.
                        The sportsbook covers 30+ sport categories across 50,000+ pre-match and in-play markets,
                        including an especially deep esports section spanning CS2, Dota 2, and League of Legends.</p>
                    <h2>Payments &amp; Withdrawal Speeds</h2>
                    <p>22Bet is one of the most payment-flexible casinos available to Irish players. Over 150
                        total methods are supported globally, with approximately 40 available in most European
                        markets. The cryptocurrency selection is exceptional — more than 30 digital assets are
                        accepted, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT)</li>
                        <li>Dogecoin (DOGE), Dash, Tron (TRX), Chainlink (LINK), Cardano (ADA)</li>
                        <li>20+ further altcoins including Verge, QTUM, and PAX</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For fiat users, Visa, Mastercard, Skrill, Neteller, Jeton, Payz, Paysafecard, and bank
                        transfer are all available. The minimum deposit is just &euro;1, one of the lowest in
                        the industry. 22Bet charges no fees on its side for deposits or withdrawals, though
                        network and provider fees may apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>Withdrawal speeds:</strong> Crypto and e-wallet cashouts are processed same-day,
                        typically within a few hours once KYC is cleared. First-time withdrawals may take up to
                        24 hours as the casino completes its verification process. Card withdrawals take 3&ndash;7
                        business days depending on your bank. The standard daily withdrawal limit is $4,000,
                        with higher caps unlocked through the VIP programme.</p>
                    <h2>Security &amp; Fairness</h2>
                    <p>22Bet is owned and operated by <strong>TechSolutions Group N.V.</strong>, incorporated in
                        Curacao. The platform holds a Curacao eGaming licence and uses SSL/TLS 1.3 encryption
                        across all connections. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is available for accounts.
                        Games are supplied exclusively by certified providers with independently verified RNG
                        engines. The platform is audited by iTech Labs for game fairness across its full
                        catalogue.</p>
                    <p>Responsible gambling tools include a self-assessment quiz, self-exclusion available via
                        live chat, and deposit limit options. Customer support is available 24/7 via live chat
                        in 25+ languages, with response times under one minute in most cases. Email support
                        is available for specific departments including security and payments, with responses
                        within 24 hours. A dedicated mobile app is available for both iOS and Android at no
                        cost.</p>
                    <p>It should be noted that third-party review platforms record a meaningful volume of player
                        complaints at 22Bet, particularly around KYC delays, account closures, and withdrawal
                        processing times for large amounts. Positive reviews consistently highlight the
                        breadth of the game library, competitive sports odds, and the speed of crypto and
                        e-wallet cashouts once verification is complete. Irish players are currently accepted.
                        22Bet does not serve players from the UK, USA, France, Netherlands, or several other
                        regulated markets.</p>

                        <p>Yes. 22Bet enforces full KYC verification before any withdrawal can be processed. You
                            are not required to verify immediately after registration, but your first withdrawal
                            request will be held pending until the process is complete. You will need to provide
                            a government-issued photo ID (passport or driving licence), proof of address dated
                            within the last 3 months, and confirmation of the payment method used for your
                            deposit. The KYC check typically takes a few hours; subsequent withdrawals are
                            approved much faster once verified.</p>
