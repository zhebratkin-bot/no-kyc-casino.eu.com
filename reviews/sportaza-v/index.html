                    <h2>Registration Process</h2>
                    <p>Signing up at Sportaza follows a three-step process. The first step is choosing your welcome
                        bonus — you can opt for either a casino offer, a sports betting offer, or no bonus at all.
                        This choice is made before entering your personal details, so it is worth reviewing both
                        options carefully before committing. The subsequent steps ask for your email address, personal
                        information, and account currency.</p>
                    <p>Account creation is straightforward, but it is important to be aware that <strong>KYC
                            verification is mandatory before any withdrawal can be processed</strong>. The casino
                        recommends completing verification early — immediately after registration — to avoid delays
                        when you request your first payout. Documents may be requested either before or after a
                        deposit, or at the point of your first withdrawal request. Failure to provide documents within
                        10 working days can result in voided winnings under the casino's general terms.</p>
                    <h3>Bonus &amp; Promotions</h3>
                    <p>The casino welcome offer matches your first deposit 100% up to &euro;500, with 200 Free Spins
                        delivered in batches of 20 per day across 10 consecutive days. The sports welcome offer
                        provides a separate matched deposit or free bet deal for sports bettors.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Casino Welcome Bonus:</strong> 100% up to &euro;500 + 200 Free Spins</li>
                        <li><strong>Minimum deposit to activate:</strong> &euro;20</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering requirement:</strong> 35x the bonus and deposit amount on slots</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering on table games:</strong> 350x (Blackjack, Roulette, Poker)</li>
                        <li><strong>Wagering on Free Spins winnings:</strong> 35x</li>
                        <li><strong>Max bet while clearing bonus:</strong> &euro;5</li>
                        <li><strong>Bonus validity:</strong> 10 days</li>
                        <li><strong>Note:</strong> Skrill and Neteller deposits do not qualify</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Ongoing promotions include a weekly reload bonus with 50 Free Spins, a 25% live casino
                        cashback of up to &euro;200, weekend free spin offers, and regular slot tournaments. The
                        Sportaza Cup is a recurring competitive event with prize pools open to all registered players.
                        Loyalty points earned through deposits, bets, and challenge completions can be exchanged in
                        the Bonus Shop for free spins, bonus cash, and free bets.</p>
                    <h2>Games &amp; Software Providers</h2>
                    <p>Sportaza's casino lobby features over 5,500 titles from 84+ software providers, making it
                        one of the more comprehensively stocked platforms in its category. Slots dominate the
                        offering, with high-volatility titles from Nolimit City, Hacksaw Gaming, Big Time Gaming,
                        and Push Gaming alongside the established catalogues of NetEnt, Microgaming, Play'n GO,
                        and Pragmatic Play. The platform also carries 100+ exclusive Sportaza-branded titles,
                        including jackpot games with multi-million progressive prizes.</p>
                    <p>The live casino is powered primarily by <strong>Evolution Gaming</strong>, with additional
                        tables from Ezugi and Pragmatic Play Live. The selection covers all standard formats —
                        Roulette, Blackjack, Baccarat, and Poker — as well as a wide range of game shows including
                        Crazy Time, Monopoly Live, Lightning Roulette, and Gonzo's Treasure Hunt Live. Betting
                        limits across live tables run from &euro;0.10 up to &euro;10,000 per hand. The full
                        sportsbook covers 30,000+ pre-match and in-play markets across football, basketball, tennis,
                        esports, horse racing, and virtual sports, with Cash Out available on selected events.</p>
                    <h2>Payments &amp; Withdrawal Speeds</h2>
                    <p>Sportaza supports both traditional and cryptocurrency payment methods. Key accepted options
                        include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Tether (USDT)</li>
                        <li>Visa and Mastercard</li>
                        <li>Skrill, Neteller, MuchBetter, Neosurf, and Flexepin</li>
                        <li>Bank transfer and selected local payment methods</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All deposits are instant and processed without fees on the casino's side. The minimum deposit
                        is &euro;10 for most methods, rising to &euro;20 for bonus eligibility. Crypto and e-wallet
                        withdrawals are processed instantly once approved. Card and bank transfer payouts follow a
                        3&ndash;5 business day window, with a three business day pending period applied to all
                        withdrawals. Withdrawals are processed Monday to Friday between 6am and 5pm UTC only.</p>
                    <p>Standard withdrawal limits start at <strong>&euro;500 per day and &euro;10,000 per
                            month</strong> at base level, increasing through the VIP programme. Players should note that
                        no withdrawal of any kind will be processed until full KYC verification is complete.</p>
                    <h2>Security &amp; Fairness</h2>
                    <p>Sportaza is operated by <strong>Rabidi N.V.</strong>, the same company behind sister brands
                        5Gringos and 7Signs. The platform holds licences from both the Curacao eGaming Authority
                        and the Anjouan iGaming regulator. All player data and transactions are secured with SSL
                        encryption. Games are independently audited by iTech Labs and eCOGRA, with certified
                        Random Number Generators guaranteeing unbiased outcomes across the full game library.</p>
                    <p>Responsible gambling tools include self-exclusion via live chat and deposit limit options.
                        Customer support is available around the clock via live chat in 16+ languages, including
                        English, German, Polish, and Norwegian. Phone support is not available.</p>
                    <p>It is worth noting that Sportaza does not accept players from the UK, USA, Sweden, the
                        Netherlands, France, Malta, or several other jurisdictions. Irish players are currently
                        accepted. Player feedback on third-party review platforms is mixed — positive reviews
                        highlight fast e-wallet payouts and strong sports odds, while negative reviews frequently
                        cite delays during KYC and slow withdrawal processing for card users. We recommend
                        completing your KYC documents immediately after registration to avoid any hold-ups when
                        you withdraw.</p>

                        Does Sportaza require KYC verification?
                        <div class="faq-icon"></div>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes. Sportaza enforces full KYC verification before any withdrawal can be processed. You
                            will be required to provide a government-issued photo ID (passport or driving licence),
                            proof of address dated within the last 3 months, and proof of ownership for your payment
                            method. Sportaza recommends completing this process immediately after registration to
                            avoid delays. Verification typically takes 1&ndash;3 days but can extend up to 10
                            business days. Failure to provide documents within 10 working days may result in voided
